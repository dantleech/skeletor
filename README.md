Skeletor is a rather stupid universal project generator which uses github
repositories such as [this one](https://github.com/dantleech/phplin.skel) as
skeleton repositories.

- Uses ``{{ mustache }}`` like templates.
- Skeletons are hosted on Github.
- Skeletons are installed locally (i.e. they work offline).
- Interactive generation.
- Almost 1000 skeletor quotes.

## Installation and Usage

See the project [website](http://dantleech.github.io/skeletor) for
