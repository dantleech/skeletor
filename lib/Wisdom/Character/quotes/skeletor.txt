People of Eternia! I stand before the Great Eye of the galaxy. Chosen by destiny to receive the powers of Greyskull! This inevitable moment will transpire before your eyes, even as He-Man himself bears witness to it. Now. I, Skeletor, am Master of the Universe! YES! Yes... I feel it, the power... fills me. Yes, I feel the universe within me! I am... I am a part of the cosmos! Its energy flows... flows through me! Of what consequence are you now? This planet, these people, they are nothing to me! The universe is power - pure, unstoppable power! And I am that force, I am that power! KNEEL BEFORE YOUR MASTER! [He-Man refuses] 
Fool! You are no longer my equal! I am more than man! More than life! I... am... a... GOD! Now. You... will... KNELL! KNELL! 
YOU! You will no longer stand between me and my destiny! 
I ache to smash you out of existence! To drive your cursed face from my memories forever! 
YES! Let this be our final battle! 
Kneel before your master... [He-Man refuses] 
... fool, you are no longer my equal, I am more than man, more than life... I am a GOD! 
He-Man lives and possesses that key! I must possess all, or I possess nothing! 
You are all aware of the penalty for failure
I am not in a giving vein this day. [incinerates Sauron; Beastman grabs his feet, begging for his life] 
GET AWAY! 
[pushing her away towards them] Save your pity for yourself if you fail. Take them and whatever troops and resources you need
Then you should not have spoken. Leave immediately. When you find the key, send a sourcing signal. An attack force will join you or I will follow
NO! Mine
Someone is speaking to me... yes. Sorceress, my lovely prisoner, my prisoner at last. I've won. I've won. The darkness is rising to embrace you
Really? How sensitive you are. Can you feel - this? [uses his magic to absorb her strength]
Not the way to treat your beloved ruler! Throw down your weapons or you die! 
Where are they? Where are your friends now? Tell me about the loneliness of good, He-Man. Is it equal to the loneliness of evil? 
Everything comes to he who waits... and I have waited so very long for this moment
Your wonderous Sorceress will die! 
I dare anything! I am Skeletor! Throw down your weapons and pledge yourselves to me! Or you will join her! 
Silence! 
Do you hear, Sorceress? The final moment has come. All the forces of Greyskull, all the powers in the universe will be vested in me! ME! And you will cease to exist! 
[speaking of the Great Eye] Madness! I demand of destitution, shame, and loneliness of scorn. It is my destiny! It is my right! Nothing will deter me from it! 
[laughs] Thank you for that bit of philosophy, Sorceress. Here is my response. [Blade brings the Sword of Greyskull forward] 
Yes, Sorceress! The Sword of Greyskull! Mine! Now and forever! [He-Man is brought forward] 
Your champion
[to He-Man] Where is your strength? Where has it gone? Look at your precious Sorceress - now grown weak... withering... dying. Are you ready to kneel now, proud warrior? 
Do you hear? The Alpha... and the Omega... death and rebirth... and as you die, so will I be reborn! 
Witness this moment, He-Man! This moment where the powers of Greyskull will become mine for eternity! Our life-long battle in ending at last in the only way it could. When the Great Eye opens. The people of Eternia will see you kneel before me, just before you die! 
Yes, you will! Yes, you will! Or I shall wreak unforgettable harm upon you! 
Leave them alone. He-Man is my slave. As long as I let them live, he is bound by his word. Let them rot. [laughs] 
Let them rot
[laughs]
Stay where you are, He-Man! One more move and your friends will not live to see another day! I give you a choice. Return with me to Eternia as my slave and save their miserable lives, or perish with them on this primitive and tasteless planet. Surrender your sword. [last lines] 
Because unlike you, Batros has a brain. What he has taken is more precious than gold or jewels
Of course, you worthless hunk of fur. Books are the real treasures of the world
Do what I tell you, desert sand, for you are under my command! 
[snickers] I'm considering putting him on a leash
More tricks, Batros? Or are you ready to talk business? 
I'll talk, and you'll obey! You're clever, Batros. Unlike some of my servants, who can hardly think at all. You have a brain that could warm my heart, if I had a heart
You see, Beast Man? Some use their heads for something besides growing fur
Struggle all you want, He-Man, that net is made of Elastium. It's not only one of the hardest substances in the universe, but it also stretches. You and your stupid beast are helpless! [Battle Cat growls in defence] 
As you can see, General, when I require intelligent assistance, I have to look somewhere besides Snake Mountain. That's why I called on you
That, and because you are heartless! When I said heartless, I meant just that. As you are a goblin, I understand you do not have a heart
But this time, we're not going to defeat He-Man
No, this time He-Man is going to defeat himself! [cackles wickedly] 
[cackles] Foolish Orko! This prison has been magiced proof! None of your pitiful little spells will work on it
A mesotronic bomb! 
You wouldn't dare! 
I don't need four minutes to defeat you! [hits Teela with two bolts of magic] 
[cackles wickedly] There is the answer to my evil needs! 
It's a giant spacecraft, tin-head, and it's filled with thousands of Bee-people. If I could capture this spacecraft and enslave all the bee-people, I would have an army large enough to take on Horde-Prime himself! And if I can conquer Horde-Prime, the universe shall be mine! [more laughter] 
Trap Jaw, Beast Man! 
Both of you shall accompany me on my invasion of this Hive-ship. Get the sleep gas devises, Beast Man. And Trap Jaw, make sure your sun ray is fully charged. We don't want to hurt anyone, but... we will have got a lot of Bee-people to convince. [chuckles wickedly] 
Sleep gas and stun rays only, my evil henchmen. No one must be hurt. After all, they're going to be joining my army soon! [cackles wickedly] 
That's too bad, bug-brain, because you are all now part of Skeletor's army! 
I don't recall giving you a choice, Bee-man. You will be doing as I command, wether you like it... [fires a bolt of persuasion] 
or not! 
[Skeletor enters] Inventions? I always need new inventions! 
You mean I could use a new Wind Raider! 
I could write a book about what you don't know! 
[about He-Man] He's as weak as a slime-kitten. Even you two could capture him
I had to take time off from destroying the swamp people's village, just to rescue you. And you didn't even have He-Man! 
Well, it's, it's a dark and dismal
Just like any home, really
[conversing through the Window of Spirits] Back up, Muscle-boy! I want to know what you've done to the plants
Yes, because they're bugging the big bones out of me
[about Evilseed] Who does that cabbage think he is? 
There isn't! Never has been, never will be
Unite with Castle Grayskull? Never! Never will I set foot in Castle Grayskull until the day I enter as it's conqueror
Don't you ever feel like doing something evil? 
[but the evil warriors are now stuck instead] Nice going, Whiplash! They've gotten away while were stuck in this vile swamp
[leading a procession of 10 Skeletoids] Here comes King Skeletor! [laughs] 
I want you to witness the effects of my genius first hand
Give him another ray of weakness! 
Behold: the Evilgizer! It's a little invention I've been toying with. It can increase the evil power of anyone inside it ten times over, making that person the most evil being on Eternia
There's just one catch
I made the Evilgizer for myself, but then I found that it may have certain unforeseen dangers
A, a volunteer! Contratulation, Spikor. And good luck [chuckles] 
You're going to need it
Yes, we'll win this game the old fashioned way, the tried and true way: we'll cheat. [laughs] 
Then we can do whatever we want! And we will! 
At last I will witness the defeat of He-Man! As long as that fool Spikor doesn't mess things up
Not exactly
[through wrist comlink] Well, is it working? 
Hit the button, Maddok! 
[to Maddok] And if your contraption doesn't work this time, I'm giving Beast Man his job back
When we get back to Snake Mountain, Maddok, I'm gonna show you how angry I can get, without an Anger-Beam
With this Gate-Maker I will be able to open a door to Etheria so big, that I can use it to send the entire Royal Palace through, getting rid of everyone all at the same time! [evil laughter] 
Here, She-Ra, a gift: this power bolt was made just for you. [fires his Havok staff] 
Lets see now, which way to find Modulok? [a blaster bolt hits near Skeletor's feet] 
Hordak! You oversized rust-bucket! 
Hmm. He-Man and She-Ra against Hordak. Hmm, I'm just in time. I could help them, I could work with them instead of against them. We could defeat Hordak together. Hmmm, I think I'll wait and see who wins instead
[to Spikor] Well, nail-head, what shall we do to make life miserable for King Randor today? 
Greetings, Hordak. I'm glad to see you. It will give me the pleasure of freezing you in your tracks
Chew on this, bolt-breath! 
This is between me and Hordak
Just like He-Man, always meddling! 
I think I'll make King Randor my court jester when I conquer Eternia. If he's funny enough... [snickers] 
I know the way, He-Man. I've been there before [chuckles wickedly] 
Snake Mountain you will pay for this He man! 
When I give the word you attack He man I mean all of you
Form an alliance with you never! 
Very well we will form an alliance, but only until our task is complete
They are ready for transporting, Beast Man. The dragon's eggs. And the dragon pearl... Mer-Man found it in the Slime Swamp. [cackles] 
The fool traded it to me for Eternian silver. He doesn't know it's value. He doesn't know
[cackles] I'm so powerful I even impress myself! 
Did you say something? 
Our new home: Castle Grayskull! 
Trouble? [laughs] 
I'll show you trouble, Sorceress! 
Silence, fools! The Starseed must be near. Absolute power is within my grasp! 
You flipping fool! Within minutes the whole cosmos will be my slave! 
Hear me, oh Starseed. Encase He-Man in chains which not even he can break. Then, send him away to the furthest planet of the coldest star in the universe
We're not so far apart, are we, He-Man? 
You're becoming evil, He-Man, I can sense it. Then join forces with me. Together we will rule! 
I don't know, but with most of our evil allies in jail, or on missions elsewhere, I could use his sinister power
No one says 'no' to Skeletor, fool! I'll force you to serve me. [cackles wickedly] 
After we use this dolt to help us break into Grayskull, you can have him for a slave, Beast Man
Another few seconds, and Grayskull is mine! 
Tell me about this army of yours
Wonderful! 
[He-Man has evaded Skeletor's powerballs] Ah, you leap like a swamp hopper, He-Man. But you can't avoid them forever
Oh He-Man, how you vex me! 
Attack He-Man, you filthy beast! 
I want Eternia. All of it! The entire universe! And I'm not one step closer than the day I started! 
Stand your ground, you crab-faced coward! 
[about Castle Grayskull] I hate this place! 
Let me out of here, you goody-goody witch, you! 
The Sorceress is in Grayskull, Celice. You will use your siren song to hypnotise her and then sing the jawbridge down. Go! 
Let go of me, flesh-face, or I'll
[Skeletor is trapped in a bubble] A zero-G bubble
[to Mer-Man] I should banish you to the burning desert, where there's no water! 
If you needed Rainbow Quartz, why didn't you just ask? 
Not again! I had Teela right in the palm of my hand. [grumbles] 
Why does this always happen to me? 
[reading inscription] Beware the Mirror of Moravad, where bad is good, and good is bad. Where one may come, two depart, but only one may have the heart
Skeletor's double: Yes, I am. Here, let me try to get you out
Skeletor's double: And what do you think you're doing? 
Skeletor's double: Never mind what I said, just do what I said
[cackles] A slight correction, intruder: it is a monument to greatness! 
A nice, safe empty place, eh, Skeletor? 
And I'm about to teach you a lesson. We'll see how brave you talk when Castle Grayskull is mine! 
I'll break the seals and claim it's treasures for myself! Who knows what lurks behind these doors? 
Raven, raven, fly to me. Raven, raven, what did you see? 
Aha! The legendary lost secrets, well, I shall find them first! 
I bid you a fond farewell, forever! [laughs while teleporting away] 
Silence! You fishmonger, I'll throw you back in the ocean before you ever rule Snake Mountain! 
Why Glitch, how really unpleasant it is to see you, you sniveling coward
You're right, He-Man, it is time I was going
You're no match for me, He-Man. [fires his Havoc Staff] 
Not a chance, little one! 
You'll pay for this, He-Man
Beast Man, can you communicate with that furry pet of yours? 
Beast Man, you clumsy oaf, put your seatbelt on! 
Come back here, I'll make Hollywag pie out of you! I'll turn you into a paperweight! 
A female He-Man! Aw-Haw! This is the worst day of my life! 
Skeletor to King Randor, Skeletor to King Randor. Come in, you royal boob! 
You left me with our enemies! 
Perhaps you are right
I cannot control Daimar, so I will conquer him! 
He-Man, you are a fool! Daimar was not born to think, only to serve his superiors. He will follow my orders
Join me, Daimar, we'll rule Eternia together! 
Now what am I going to do with a Toy Maker, hm? Take over Eternia with an army of toy bears? [cackles mockingly] 
At last, He-Man, I have defeated you. You're doomed. Doomed! Doomed. [evil laughter] 
Eternia is mine! 
No, I'm only interested in saving myself
Hm, He-Man wants something, I'll let him in and find out what it is. But what he's going to get won't be what he wants! 
Something's happened to the Sorceress? 
But I don't, He-Man, I really don't. I haven't done anything to the Sorceress... recently
Tell me, He-Man, do you like falcons? 
Because you're going to have one for company for a very long time! 
It's been, how long? 
That's right! [they laugh and snicker] 
He-Man is a lucky fool! One day shall destroy him and his friends in the palace
Heh! Don't tell me you've come to put him in your army? 
But he will resist. He is not like any of your others
Well, take him then. You will be doing me a favor! 
Impressive, you boob! It was spectacular. You're army is nothing without him
Well, I hope He-Man tries to stop us, because this time, we will crush him! [crushes a diamond in his fist to prove his point] 
[on viewscreen] You haven't won yet, He-Man. Your precious Man-At-Arms is still in my not-so-safe keeping
I have chosen you to lead my warriors into battle against the palace of Eternia
You and your wonderful stink-power, are the very key to my new offensive
And you will scrub until every piece of armor is gleaming 
Because, unlike the rest of you, Odiphus has proved himself useful! 
You're crying for Hordak? I don't believe it! 
I hate to leave this touching scene, but I see my plan has failed. I'll be back another time, my 'friend'
Confound it! I must find out the source of this infernal rumbling
Not mumbling, you meat-heads! Rumbling. Rrrrrumbling! 
Looks like it's moving time for the insect people! [evil laughter] 
Quick, you two. Get out there
And now, Princess, I must decide what to do with you
A female He-Man? This is the worst day of my life! 
Are we flying backwards, beastie? Why haven't we reached Castle Grayskull? 
I, Skeletor, Master of the Universe, have awakened you! 
I never ever do anything for goodness sake. [small chuckle] 
Everything I do, is for the sake of evil
Not in this body. [laughs and shakes his fists] 
When are you goody-goody fools going to understand? I am completely and utterly evil. I live to be bad! I care for no one and no one cares for me
Forget it, Zagraz is mine. You want him, then you have to fight for him
No, you're wrong. I think about ruling all Eternia more than I think about fighting. Fighting is a close second
[laughing] At last I won, the wheel spins! 
Fool! You've broken loose the Time Wheel. It will explode! You may have saved Grayskull, but you've doomed yourself! 
I am sorry, Evil-Lyn, but capturing He-Man is more important than the personal comfort of those who serve me
To capture He-Man, I'd sell out anyone! 
[on viewscreen, laughing] That's solid magnetic force you're trapped in, He-Man! Not even a mega-bomb could dent it. Not only have you lost the disks, you've lost your freedom as well! 
It was torture, wasn't it? To be invisible in the world of men, unable to touch anyone, to speak to anyone? 
Then give me the disks! I will free you from the Phantom Dimension forever. And together we will attack Zodac and your other enemies who put you there
Right, He-Fool! 
Greetings, King Randor. Unless you'd like my pet here to demolish the palace, you'll surrender to me immediately
Ah, but I can! 
This is becoming a wonderful day for evil! Soon I shall have Teela, Buzz-Off and that silly little bag of wind all in my power
You've been awfully quiet today, Evil-Lyn. I thought I'd see what you were up to. Hm. What's this? 
I can see it right in front of me, Evil-Lyn, so it's not nothing
Like I said, there's nothing he can say that will convince me... except that
Welcome, He-Man. Are you here to pledge your loyalty to the new ruler of Eternia? 
It's the Sorceress, you boob
Your mistake will cost you dearly, old enemy. I'm about to rid Eternia of your hated presence forever. You'll feel nothing, He-Man. But you will no longer be a problem to me. By the powers of darkness, evil and fear, I command He-Man's memory to now disappear
Doorway, now prove that Skeletor is clever. Sweep He-Man inside you and hold him forever! 
[about to cast another spell on Elmora] Your hatred of me will work in my favor. Every time you look at He-Man you will see my face. And you will think it is me! [evil laughter] 
No one 'gets' Skeletor. Away! 
The Egg of Avion is mine! Soon we'll all have wings! 
[to He-Man] I have you now, you muscle bound oaf! 
Quiet! I'm trying to think
[raises voice] Quiet! 
[to Beast Man] You furry, flea bitten fool, I'll cover my throne with your hide! 
[rises from his throne] So be it! 
When you can move again you can tell your people: if they want Prince Adam back, send He-Man to get him. We'll be in the Banshee Jungle
He-Man! You're a fool if you think you can stop me, here. [cackles wickedly] 
Now we're playing in my dimension, and I make all the rules
He-Man, your ugly friend sacrificed himself for nothing! 
[cackles] Honey yours, Kingdom mine, once we take the King's warehouse
Some days, nothing goes right! 
[communicating via a magic spell] I have received word that that troublemaker Adam has arrived on the Bright Moon and is attempting to bring peace
You must use all your powers to bring misery and despair to the people of the Dark Moon. I... want... war! 
[cackles] Welcome, He-Man
Of course, He-Man. Just as soon as you escort me into Castle Grayskull
Webstor! Webstor, where are you? 
I have a little job for you, bug face. Pay attention! 
[scolding Whiplash for a botched job] They should call you Wimplash
Quiet, or I'll turn you into a suitcase! 
[on viewscreen] Because you were a wimp scientist and you could be a wimp villain. Prove to me what you can do. Then we'll discuss letting you 'join up'
Ah... a people who can built, travel through time, yet are unable to defend themselves... I like that! 
DON'T CALL ME BONEHEAD! 
Yes... I... I do. [blasts He-Man] 
Had my fingers crossed
I will make another He-Man. An evil one called Faker. [and indeed he does with just a flick of his wrist] 
I have done it! A perfect likeness of He-Man. Sometimes my power even amazes me! 
[magical apparition] Stop complaining, go home! The only person who's going to enjoy this circus is me! [cackles evilly] 
[imitating Kobra Khan] Niccccccce? 
[over intercom] Skreeech, prepare to attack. You will surprise He-Man from above, grab him in your claws and carry him to the lake of Oblivion and drop him in! [cackles] 
Are you ready, my darling Screeech? Attack! 
The storm works it's evil. Soon all Eternia will be devastated and I will reign supreme! 
Only if you do your part right, Evil-Lyn! 
Hmm. Whatever Demos and He-Man seek must have incredible power. I can wait no longer, I must have it for myself! 
[speaking to the audience] I'll be back! 
People of Eternia, the war is over. My forces are victorious. The Sorceress of Greyskull is my prisoner, and her powers are now joined with mine! Let this be my first decree... those who do not pledge themselves to me shall be destroyed! The new age begins! 
I lied! Farewell, He-Man! 
Ha! Got you at last, you troublesome tots! 
Drat that Hordak! 
[Skeletor picks up a dog and starts to carry him] I don't know what's coming over me, but whatever it is, I don't like it! 
[the dog licks his face] Stop licking my face, you bratty dog! Get away from me! You're drowning me! 
I am *not* nice! 
Tell me more about this "Christmas." 
You mean they get in fights? 
Fights are fun. I like fights! 
And when you open them, they explode, right? 
Nice? Doesn't sound like much fun to me! 
Listen - I am not nice, I am not kind, and I am *not* wonderful! 
She-Ra and He-Man! Drat! 
Hordak! Double drat! 
I don't know what's happening to me, but I must save the children! 
You? You can't even handle that musclebound female, She-Ra
Bone-brain? Why you miserable excuse for a villain! 
Oh, oh, I don't think I feel well
Well I don't like to feel good. I like to feel evil. Oooh
Ah, thank goodness! 
Forwards, my lackeys, in the name of destruction! 
You think you're handy with that sword, huh? Well, try this: 
Curse you, He-Man. Some day I'll have the power to destroy you. Some day! 
Dolts! Halfwits! Brainless idiots, you couldn't even beat a motley group of gnomes! 
How else can I act, when I'm surrounded by such fools! 
Once the Coridite is hot enough, I'll mold it into the image of my own breastplate. When worn against my skin, it will add to my strength a hundred times over, making me mighty enough to crush He-Man! 
Now I have the power! 
This is the way it had to end! With Skeletor triumphant at last! 
Very interesting. So that little floating bag of wind has a secret hidden somewhere... Perhaps we should let this walking lightbulb, Aremesh, do our dirty work for us! [cackles] 
I must find that robotic lightbulb before he gets the secret for himself! 
I am hurrying, I'm hurrying! 
[cackles] Soon the Electroid and that little floating runt will be in my possession! 
Perhaps if I will help you get the secret, you will help me take over Eternia. Agreed? 
Oh yes! 
[to Beast Man] You overgrown fur coat, you let him get away! 
[to Battle Cat] You overgrown alley cat! [Battle Cat laughs at Skeletor, sounding not unlike Muttley] 
My patience grows thin! [neither Beast Man nor Trap Jaw responds] 
I said, my patience grows thin! 
Thin! Very thin! 
You tin-tongued dolt, I'm talking about my patience, not my body
Castle Grayskull is the source of ultimate power. Power which must be mine! I have tried to conquer it six times
Six, you flea-bitten fur- brain! The first one didn't count, it was only practice. I was teasing the poor fool
Oh, why do I surround myself with fools? Even the robots are smarter than you. [drops to the ground in exasperation] 
[looking up from his position on the floor] I mean both of you, you pathetic pair of pitiful pinheads! 
Beast Man, go get the power chains. We don't want our guests to escape
I hope so. You must be good for something
Make ready to attack, men. Beast Man, you fly the Collector. Be ready to scoop up the guards as we conquer them
Trap Jaw, you will control the robot ships from the Basher. Trap Jaw: Right, boss. [exits for the Basher] 
And I myself shall lead the attack in the Doom Buster! 
It's a pity that your chains prevent you from bowing before the new king of Eternia
Because unlike you, Batros has a brain. What he has taken is more precious than gold or jewels
Of course, you worthless hunk of fur. Books are the real treasures of the world
Do what I tell you, desert sand, for you are under my command! 
[snickers] I'm considering putting him on a leash
More tricks, Batros? Or are you ready to talk business? 
I'll talk, and you'll obey! You're clever, Batros. Unlike some of my servants, who can hardly think at all. You have a brain that could warm my heart, if I had a heart
You see, Beast Man? Some use their heads for something besides growing fur

A mesotronic bomb! 
You wouldn't dare!

[through wrist comlink] Well, is it working? 
Hit the button, Maddok! 
[to Maddok] And if your contraption doesn't work this time, I'm giving Beast Man his job back
When we get back to Snake Mountain, Maddok, I'm gonna show you how angry I can get, without an Anger-Beam
With this Gate-Maker I will be able to open a door to Etheria so big, that I can use it to send the entire Royal Palace through, getting rid of everyone all at the same time! [evil laughter] 
Here, She-Ra, a gift: this power bolt was made just for you. [fires his Havok staff] 
Lets see now, which way to find Modulok? [a blaster bolt hits near Skeletor's feet] 
Hordak! You oversized rust-bucket! 
Hmm. He-Man and She-Ra against Hordak. Hmm, I'm just in time. I could help them, I could work with them instead of against them. We could defeat Hordak together. Hmmm, I think I'll wait and see who wins instead
[to Spikor] Well, nail-head, what shall we do to make life miserable for King Randor today? 
Greetings, Hordak. I'm glad to see you. It will give me the pleasure of freezing you in your tracks
Chew on this, bolt-breath! 
Just like He-Man, always meddling! 
I think I'll make King Randor my court jester when I conquer Eternia. If he's funny enough... [snickers] 
I know the way, He-Man. I've been there before [chuckles wickedly] 
Snake Mountain you will pay for this He man! 
When I give the word you attack He man I mean all of you
Form an alliance with you never! 
Very well we will form an alliance, but only until our task is complete
They are ready for transporting, Beast Man. The dragon's eggs. And the dragon pearl... Mer-Man found it in the Slime Swamp. [cackles] 
The fool traded it to me for Eternian silver. He doesn't know it's value. He doesn't know
[cackles] I'm so powerful I even impress myself! 
Did you say something? 
Our new home: Castle Grayskull! 
Trouble? [laughs] 
I'll show you trouble, Sorceress! 
Silence, fools! The Starseed must be near. Absolute power is within my grasp! 
You flipping fool! Within minutes the whole cosmos will be my slave! 
Hear me, oh Starseed. Encase He-Man in chains which not even he can break. Then, send him away to the furthest planet of the coldest star in the universe
We're not so far apart, are we, He-Man? 
You're becoming evil, He-Man, I can sense it. Then join forces with me. Together we will rule! 
I don't know, but with most of our evil allies in jail, or on missions elsewhere, I could use his sinister power
No one says 'no' to Skeletor, fool! I'll force you to serve me. [cackles wickedly] 
After we use this dolt to help us break into Grayskull, you can have him for a slave, Beast Man
Another few seconds, and Grayskull is mine! 
Tell me about this army of yours
Wonderful! 
[He-Man has evaded Skeletor's powerballs] Ah, you leap like a swamp hopper, He-Man. But you can't avoid them forever
Oh He-Man, how you vex me! 
Attack He-Man, you filthy beast! 
I want Eternia. All of it! The entire universe! And I'm not one step closer than the day I started! 
Stand your ground, you crab-faced coward! 
[about Castle Grayskull] I hate this place! 
Let me out of here, you goody-goody witch, you! 
The Sorceress is in Grayskull, Celice. You will use your siren song to hypnotise her and then sing the jawbridge down. Go! 
Let go of me, flesh-face, or I'll
[Skeletor is trapped in a bubble] A zero-G bubble
[to Mer-Man] I should banish you to the burning desert, where there's no water! 
If you needed Rainbow Quartz, why didn't you just ask? 
Not again! I had Teela right in the palm of my hand. [grumbles] 
Why does this always happen to me? 
[reading inscription] Beware the Mirror of Moravad, where bad is good, and good is bad. Where one may come, two depart, but only one may have the heart
Skeletor's double: Yes, I am. Here, let me try to get you out
Skeletor's double: And what do you think you're doing? 
Skeletor's double: Never mind what I said, just do what I said
[cackles] A slight correction, intruder: it is a monument to greatness! 
A nice, safe empty place, eh, Skeletor? 
And I'm about to teach you a lesson. We'll see how brave you talk when Castle Grayskull is mine! 
I'll break the seals and claim it's treasures for myself! Who knows what lurks behind these doors? 
Raven, raven, fly to me. Raven, raven, what did you see? 
Aha! The legendary lost secrets, well, I shall find them first! 
I bid you a fond farewell, forever! [laughs while teleporting away] 
Silence! You fishmonger, I'll throw you back in the ocean before you ever rule Snake Mountain! 
Why Glitch, how really unpleasant it is to see you, you sniveling coward
You're right, He-Man, it is time I was going
You're no match for me, He-Man. [fires his Havoc Staff] 
Not a chance, little one! 
You'll pay for this, He-Man
Beast Man, can you communicate with that furry pet of yours? 
Beast Man, you clumsy oaf, put your seatbelt on! 
Come back here, I'll make Hollywag pie out of you! I'll turn you into a paperweight! 
A female He-Man! Aw-Haw! This is the worst day of my life! 
Skeletor to King Randor, Skeletor to King Randor. Come in, you royal boob! 
You left me with our enemies! 
Perhaps you are right
I cannot control Daimar, so I will conquer him! 
He-Man, you are a fool! Daimar was not born to think, only to serve his superiors. He will follow my orders
Join me, Daimar, we'll rule Eternia together! 
Now what am I going to do with a Toy Maker, hm? Take over Eternia with an army of toy bears? [cackles mockingly] 
At last, He-Man, I have defeated you. You're doomed. Doomed! Doomed. [evil laughter] 
Eternia is mine! 
No, I'm only interested in saving myself
Hm, He-Man wants something, I'll let him in and find out what it is. But what he's going to get won't be what he wants! 
Something's happened to the Sorceress? 
But I don't, He-Man, I really don't. I haven't done anything to the Sorceress... recently
Tell me, He-Man, do you like falcons? 
Because you're going to have one for company for a very long time! 
It's been, how long? 
That's right! [they laugh and snicker] 
He-Man is a lucky fool! One day shall destroy him and his friends in the palace
Heh! Don't tell me you've come to put him in your army? 
But he will resist. He is not like any of your others
Well, take him then. You will be doing me a favor! 
Impressive, you boob! It was spectacular. You're army is nothing without him
Well, I hope He-Man tries to stop us, because this time, we will crush him! [crushes a diamond in his fist to prove his point] 
[on viewscreen] You haven't won yet, He-Man. Your precious Man-At-Arms is still in my not-so-safe keeping
I have chosen you to lead my warriors into battle against the palace of Eternia
You and your wonderful stink-power, are the very key to my new offensive
And you will scrub until every piece of armor is gleaming 
Because, unlike the rest of you, Odiphus has proved himself useful! 
You're crying for Hordak? I don't believe it! 
I hate to leave this touching scene, but I see my plan has failed. I'll be back another time, my 'friend'
Confound it! I must find out the source of this infernal rumbling
Not mumbling, you meat-heads! Rumbling. Rrrrrumbling! 
Looks like it's moving time for the insect people! [evil laughter] 
Quick, you two. Get out there
And now, Princess, I must decide what to do with you
A female He-Man? This is the worst day of my life! 
Are we flying backwards, beastie? Why haven't we reached Castle Grayskull? 
I, Skeletor, Master of the Universe, have awakened you! 
I never ever do anything for goodness sake. [small chuckle] 
Everything I do, is for the sake of evil
Not in this body. [laughs and shakes his fists] 
When are you goody-goody fools going to understand? I am completely and utterly evil. I live to be bad! I care for no one and no one cares for me
Forget it, Zagraz is mine. You want him, then you have to fight for him
No, you're wrong. I think about ruling all Eternia more than I think about fighting. Fighting is a close second
[laughing] At last I won, the wheel spins! 
Fool! You've broken loose the Time Wheel. It will explode! You may have saved Grayskull, but you've doomed yourself! 
I am sorry, Evil-Lyn, but capturing He-Man is more important than the personal comfort of those who serve me
To capture He-Man, I'd sell out anyone! 
[on viewscreen, laughing] That's solid magnetic force you're trapped in, He-Man! Not even a mega-bomb could dent it. Not only have you lost the disks, you've lost your freedom as well! 
It was torture, wasn't it? To be invisible in the world of men, unable to touch anyone, to speak to anyone? 
Then give me the disks! I will free you from the Phantom Dimension forever. And together we will attack Zodac and your other enemies who put you there
Right, He-Fool! 
Greetings, King Randor. Unless you'd like my pet here to demolish the palace, you'll surrender to me immediately
Ah, but I can! 
This is becoming a wonderful day for evil! Soon I shall have Teela, Buzz-Off and that silly little bag of wind all in my power
You've been awfully quiet today, Evil-Lyn. I thought I'd see what you were up to. Hm. What's this? 
I can see it right in front of me, Evil-Lyn, so it's not nothing
Like I said, there's nothing he can say that will convince me... except that
Welcome, He-Man. Are you here to pledge your loyalty to the new ruler of Eternia? 
It's the Sorceress, you boob
Your mistake will cost you dearly, old enemy. I'm about to rid Eternia of your hated presence forever. You'll feel nothing, He-Man. But you will no longer be a problem to me. By the powers of darkness, evil and fear, I command He-Man's memory to now disappear
Doorway, now prove that Skeletor is clever. Sweep He-Man inside you and hold him forever! 
[about to cast another spell on Elmora] Your hatred of me will work in my favor. Every time you look at He-Man you will see my face. And you will think it is me! [evil laughter] 
No one 'gets' Skeletor. Away! 
The Egg of Avion is mine! Soon we'll all have wings! 
[to He-Man] I have you now, you muscle bound oaf! 
Quiet! I'm trying to think
[raises voice] Quiet! 
[to Beast Man] You furry, flea bitten fool, I'll cover my throne with your hide! 
[rises from his throne] So be it! 
When you can move again you can tell your people: if they want Prince Adam back, send He-Man to get him. We'll be in the Banshee Jungle
He-Man! You're a fool if you think you can stop me, here. [cackles wickedly] 
Now we're playing in my dimension, and I make all the rules
He-Man, your ugly friend sacrificed himself for nothing! 
[cackles] Honey yours, Kingdom mine, once we take the King's warehouse
Some days, nothing goes right! 
[communicating via a magic spell] I have received word that that troublemaker Adam has arrived on the Bright Moon and is attempting to bring peace
You must use all your powers to bring misery and despair to the people of the Dark Moon. I... want... war! 
[cackles] Welcome, He-Man
Of course, He-Man. Just as soon as you escort me into Castle Grayskull
Webstor! Webstor, where are you? 
I have a little job for you, bug face. Pay attention! 
[scolding Whiplash for a botched job] They should call you Wimplash
Quiet, or I'll turn you into a suitcase! 
[on viewscreen] Because you were a wimp scientist and you could be a wimp villain. Prove to me what you can do. Then we'll discuss letting you 'join up'
Ah... a people who can built, travel through time, yet are unable to defend themselves... I like that! 
DON'T CALL ME BONEHEAD! 
Yes... I... I do. [blasts He-Man] 
Had my fingers crossed
I will make another He-Man. An evil one called Faker. [and indeed he does with just a flick of his wrist] 
I have done it! A perfect likeness of He-Man. Sometimes my power even amazes me! 
[magical apparition] Stop complaining, go home! The only person who's going to enjoy this circus is me! [cackles evilly] 
[imitating Kobra Khan] Niccccccce? 
[over intercom] Skreeech, prepare to attack. You will surprise He-Man from above, grab him in your claws and carry him to the lake of Oblivion and drop him in! [cackles] 
Are you ready, my darling Screeech? Attack! 
The storm works it's evil. Soon all Eternia will be devastated and I will reign supreme! 
Only if you do your part right, Evil-Lyn! 
Hmm. Whatever Demos and He-Man seek must have incredible power. I can wait no longer, I must have it for myself!
